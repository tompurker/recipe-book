I apologize for the mistake. Here's a revised version of a sour dessert with squid:

# Grilled Squid with Citrus Drizzle

## Ingredients:
- 2 medium-sized squid (cleaned and prepared)
- 2 lemons (juiced)
- 1 lime (juiced)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 teaspoon chili flakes (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh cilantro (for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.
2. In a bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, lime juice, olive oil, honey, chili flakes (if desired), salt, and pepper to make the citrus drizzle.
3. Pat the squid dry with paper towels and lightly brush both sides with the citrus drizzle.
4. Place the squid on the grill and cook for about 2-3 minutes per side until nicely charred and cooked through. Avoid overcooking to prevent the squid from becoming rubbery.
5. Once cooked, transfer the grilled squid to a cutting board and let it rest for a few minutes.
6. Slice the squid into thin rings or into bite-sized pieces.
7. Arrange the grilled squid on a serving platter and drizzle with some additional citrus drizzle.
8. Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves.
9. Serve immediately as a sour and savory dessert option.
